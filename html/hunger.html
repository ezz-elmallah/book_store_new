      <h1>The Hunger Games</h1>
      <p>
        In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel "tackles
        issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of
        war among others." The novel deals with the struggle for
        self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and
        the Hunger Games in which they must participate.
