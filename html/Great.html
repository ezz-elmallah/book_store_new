       <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
      <p>
        Every character in The Great Gatsby draws inspiration from the American
        Dream's promise of wealth and prosperity. At the same time, the novel
        itself critiques the notion of the American Dream. Readers may end the
        novel wondering if the American Dream is actually attainable at all.
